## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

- ceaser cipher was developed by ceaser an was one of the earlist encription techniques
- ways to crack the cypher
  - frequency analysis
  
  - Known plaintext
    
  - Brute fource
   
- encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key
- decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key
- code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret by using a variety of clever techniques

## Ceasar Cipher

- Ceaser used this cipher when sending messages
- similar concepts inside of some more modern encryption techniques

## Cryptography Crash Course

- always will be vulnerable to attack
- cryptography is the most common form of computer security
- cipher encprys text
- permetiation cichers - read letters over a grid
- data encryption standard was one of the first software encryptors
- enigma rotor: swapped the letters in the enigma
- key exchange - two computer agree on a key without sending any keys
- enigma was a cipher machine
- computers send parts of the key to eachother and then complete it on there own ends
- lock icon means that encryption is used on the server
- substitution ciphers subs letters, vulnerable to frequency analysis
- enigma used multiple rotors and could be takin out and put at differnt starts
- asymmetric and symmetric encryption
- advanced encritpion standard uses much bigger keys and makes brute force attack mcuh harder
- diffie helman is a one way mathematical function to get a key
