## What is Tree?
A tree data structure is a non-linear data structure because it does not store in a sequential manner. It is a hierarchical structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes

## Common Terminology
**Node** - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure

**Root** - The root is the first/top Node in the tree

**Left Child** - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node

**Right Child** - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node

**Edge** - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node

**Leaf** - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children

**Height** - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Breadth First
* Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. So, given our starting tree one more time:

* Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree. Let’s break down the process.


## Binary tree
A tree whose elements have at most two children is called a binary tree. Each element in a binary tree can have only two children. A node’s left child must have a value less than its parent’s value, and the node’s right child must have a value greater than its parent value.
