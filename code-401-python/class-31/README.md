## Next.js: The React Framework
* Enter **Next.js**, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

* **Next.js** has the best-in-class "Developer Experience" and many built-in features; a sample of them are:

  * Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
  * An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
  * Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
  * Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
  * Development environment with Fast Refresh support
  * API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
  * Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
  * Fully extendable
## Setup
* First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

  * If you don’t have Node.js installed, install it from here. You’ll need Node.js version 10.13 or later.
  * You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.
  * If you are on Windows, we recommend downloading Git for Windows and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is another option.
## Create a Next.js app
* To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, cd into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

      npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/"
* Under the hood, this uses the tool called create-next-app, which bootstraps a Next.js app for you. It uses this template through the --example flag.

* If it doesn’t work, please take a look at this page.

## Run the development server
* You now have a new directory called nextjs-blog. Let’s cd into it:

    cd nextjs-blog
* Then, run the following command:

    npm run dev
