# Serverless
## What is Serverless?

Serverless is a cloud application development and execution model that lets developers build and run code without managing servers, and without paying for idle cloud infrastructure.

**FaaS** is the compute model central to serverless, and the two terms are often used interchangeably. But serverless is much more than FaaS. Serverless is an entire stack of services that can respond to specific events or requests, and scale to zero when no longer in use—and for which provisioning, management and billing are handled by the cloud provider and invisible to developers.

**FaaS, these services include:**

- Serverless databases and storage
- API gateways
- Event streaming and messaging

## Use cases for serverless

- Serverless and microservices
- API backends
- Common applications for serverless
- Data processing
- Stream processing workloads
- Massively parallel compute/“Map” operations

## Pros and cons of serverless

### Pros

- Improved developer productivity
- Pay for execution only
- Develop in any language
- Usage visibility

### cons

- Unacceptable latency for certain applications
- Higher costs for stable or predictable workloads
- Monitoring and debugging issues
- Vendor lock-in
