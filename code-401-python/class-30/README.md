## What is a Component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface

#### Views of a Component
- **object-oriented view** :A component is viewed as a set of one or more cooperating classes. Each problem domain class (analysis) and infrastructure class (design) are explained to identify all attributes and operations that apply to its implementation. It also involves defining the interfaces that enable classes to communicate and cooperate.
- **conventional view**:It is viewed as a functional element or a module of a program that integrates the processing logic, the internal data structures that are required to implement the processing logic and an interface that enables the component to be invoked and data to be passed to it.
- **process-related view**:In this view, instead of creating each component from scratch, the system is building from existing components maintained in a library. As the software architecture is formulated, components are selected from the library and used to populate the architecture

#### Characteristics of Components

- **Reusability** − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

- **Replaceable** − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

- **Not context specific** − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

- **Extensible** − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

- **Encapsulated** − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

- **Independent** − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.
