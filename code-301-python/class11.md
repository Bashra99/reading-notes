>Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

1) SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational.
2) SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data.
3) SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
4) SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores.
5) SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.

>What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Organise and unique data

>Give a real world example.
Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application

>What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
to store big data.

>Give a real world example.
A place to store the E-commerce ads.

>*Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

SQL is a better for hierarchical storage.

>**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

NoSQL as it does not require to upgrade the hardware.

>**What does SQL stand for?**

Structured Query Language.

>**What is a relational database?**

A database structured to recognize relations between stored items of information.

>What type of structure does a relational database work with?
A relational database organizes data into rows and columns, which collectively form a table. Data is typically structured across multiple tables.

>What is a 'schema'?
 A database schema is considered the “blueprint” of a database which describes how the data may relate to other tables or other data models.

>What is a NoSQL database?
Not only structured query language

>How does it work?

NoSQL databases store data in documents rather than relational tables.

>**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections.

>**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

MongoDB as it ensures high and diverse data availability

>**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

Compatibility issues with SQL instructions.
